Project 2
Simplified PageRank

 

There will be no late penalty for submitting this project late and you can submit up to 3 days late till Nov 13. However, Nov 13 is the final day for submission and you will receive a 0 after this.

 
Problem Statement

In this project you will be programming a simplified version of the Google's PageRank algorithm using an Adjacency List or equivalent implementation of the web graph. The project description handout can be found here: Project2_SimplifiedPageRank.pdf

Testing

    Test your code on Gradescope before submitting your implementation. You have five available test cases and you can submit any number of times. 
    Create your own tests and test as much as possible. 
    We will stick to the input format. No need to test for off-input statements such as inputting one URL instead of two in a line or testing whether a URL is valid or not.

 
Grading
            Documentation [15 Points]
                Submit a document addressing all these prompts:
                    Describe the data structure you used to implement the graph and why? [2.5 points]
                    What is the time complexity of each method in your implementation in the worst case in terms of Big O notation?  [5 points]
                    What is the time complexity of your main method in your implementation in the worst case in terms of Big O notation? [5 points]
                    What did you learn from this assignment and what would you do differently if you had to start over? [2.5 points]
                Code Style and Design [10 Points]
                    5 points for design decisions, a well-designed Graph API, and code modularity
                    2 points for appropriate comments
                    1 point for white spaces
                    2 points for consistent naming conventions
    Catch Tests Bonus [5 Points]
        You can score 5 bonus points if you submit a separate file containing 5 test cases (1 point/test) using the Catch Framework. These tests should be different than the public test cases. Your score is however capped to 30 points for this grading.

 
Submission

    One or more .cpp or.h files that have your implementation. Test on gradescope early and often. 
    One pdf file that has your documentation. Upper limit â€“ 3 pages with 20% deduction in report per extra page. Cover page is not required, just your name on Page 1 is sufficient.
    Optional for bonus: One pdf file that contains your Catch test cases code.

 
Frequently Asked Questions

    The course staff will maintain an active FAQ Google document to answer your questions. Post your questions in Slack, but we will answer in this document and send you the link. The link to the document is: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a9hR1Ep2IYK-MnsXwl2VxyotO1Yd-XCC8NWUkdp24JM/
